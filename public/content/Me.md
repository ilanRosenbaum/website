# About Me

Hi, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Ilan Rosenbaum. I'm an artist, photographer, cook, gardner, list maker, community member, basketball player and random project doer. For work I am a software engineer with experience across DevOps, containerization, cloud infrastructure, data pipelines, obviously some front end and design work, and a bunch of other stuff. More or less anything above OS level. I currently work for Zendesk building ITAM as a full stack engineer. If you want to contact me for anything job/work related, please feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilan-rosenbaum-a96079191/) and if you'd like to get in touch with me about photography, cooking, or anything else, feel free to reach out to me through my email, [ilan@al.net](mailto:ilan@al.net).
