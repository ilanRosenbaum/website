# Photography Page Information

The photography page contains a collection of photos I've taken over the years. I'm not a professional photographer, but I enjoy taking photos and sharing them with others. Some are taken on an iPhone 6, others on a pretty nice point and shoot. Some were taken by a 12 year old, others by a young adult. That is to say quality will very greatly. All of these photos came from my camera role but at least a couple were taken by friends and family. I tried my best to only include photos that I took myself, but I may have missed a few. If you see a photo that you took and you'd like me to remove it, please let me know and I will do so immediately. I hope you enjoy these photos as much as I enjoyed taking them. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.

## Photo Editing

I take a very minimal approach to photo editing. The vast majority (> 99%) have no editing beyond the post processing done by the device they were taken on. A few have been cropped or had brightness/color adjusted slightly using simple image editors (generally preview on macOS or a very basic Android editor) and maybe one or two are noticeably edited. Maybe I'll take a liking to photo editing in the future, but as for now, my photography is very much "as photographed".

## Favorites

The best photos I've ever taken can be found in the Kyoto page under Japan. The other areas of Japan also have some good photos but Kyoto has by far my favorite shots. "In Between" also has some pretty darn good stuff. Wisconsin & California/Bay Area have some beautiful views, but the photos themselves don't hold a candle to my favorites in Japan/Kyoto.
