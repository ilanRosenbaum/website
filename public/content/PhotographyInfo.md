# About

These are some photos I've taken over the years. I'm not a professional photographer, but I enjoy taking photos and sharing them with others. All of these photos came from my camera role but at least a couple were taken by friends and family. I tried my best to only include photos that I took myself, but I may have missed a few. If you see a photo that you took and would like me to remove it, please let me know and I will do so immediately. I hope you enjoy these photos as much as I enjoyed taking them. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.
