# How

I built roōms for Android and IOS using react-native. I host the images on Firebase storage and I use Firebase realtime database to store the user and room data. I also use Firebase authentication to authenticate users. I used various open source libraries, for the full list see the [credits page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ig0HDRsAUH3gCXS5MDTD5yWwL1DfGp6oBG1KRqCW4jE/edit?pli=1). A big thanks to everyone who created and maintains these libraries, roōms would not be possible without them. Additionally big thanks to my friends who were willing to answer so many incredibly dumb questions like should this box be slightly to the left? Should it be a dropdown menu? And so many more. I advertised roōms through physical flyers, facebook groups, and university snapchat group stories.
