# What

Come on. You got this deep into the hexagons and really don't know what the website is? Well, I guess I can't blame you I really don't know what it is either. Mostly because it's whatever I want it to be at the given moment within the bounds that I'm displaying something I made/care about & I can make it fit into hexagons. If you have interest in understanding why there are so many hexagons, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY).

For implementation details and other nerdy stuff, check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ilanRosenbaum/website/). The whole thing is open source so feel free to take a look at the code if you're curious how something was done. Not exactly the highest quality stuff in the world, but all of it works and it's pretty fast for an animated SVG so that's something right?
