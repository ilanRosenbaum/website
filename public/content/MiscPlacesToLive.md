## Formulas

If you were wondering how the "avg" column was calculated, the formulas used are below. The formulas are based on things I care about in a place to live and thus are inherently subjective.

### City score

```js
const snow = row[4] === "enough" ? 20 : row[4] === "some" ? 10 : 0;
const nature30 = row[6] === "ideal" ? 10 : row[6] === "good" ? 7 : row[6] === "ok" ? 2 : 0;
const nature2 = row[7] === "ideal" ? 10 : row[7] === "good" ? 5 : row[7] === "ok" ? 2 : 0;
const travel = row[8] === "ideal" ? 5 : row[8] === "some" ? 3 : 0;
const jobs = row[5] === "ideal" ? 35 : row[5] === "good" ? 20 : row[5] === "ok" ? 10 : 0;
const walkScore = (row[1] / 100) * 15;
const bikeScore = (row[2] / 100) * 5;
const transitScore = (row[3] / 100) * 5;

return snow + nature30 + nature2 + travel + jobs + walkScore + bikeScore + transitScore;
```

### Town/Neighborhood score

```js
const city = row[1].split(",")[0]; // Extract the city name
const cityScore = cityScores[city] || { walkScore: 50, bikeScore: 50, transitScore: 50 }; // Default to 50 if city not found

const snow = row[5] === "enough" ? 20 : row[5] === "some" ? 10 : 0;
const nature30 = row[7] === "ideal" ? 10 : row[7] === "good" ? 7 : row[7] === "ok" ? 2 : 0;
const nature2 = row[8] === "ideal" ? 10 : row[8] === "good" ? 5 : row[8] === "ok" ? 2 : 0;
const travel = row[9] === "ideal" ? 5 : row[9] === "some" ? 3 : 0;
const jobs = row[6] === "ideal" ? 35 : row[6] === "good" ? 20 : row[6] === "ok" ? 10 : 0;

// Normalize walk, bike, and transit scores based on city scores
const normalizedWalkScore = (row[2] + cityScore.walkScore) / 200;
const normalizedBikeScore = (row[3] + cityScore.bikeScore) / 200;
const normalizedTransitScore = (row[4] + cityScore.transitScore) / 200;

const walkScore = normalizedWalkScore * 15;
const bikeScore = normalizedBikeScore * 5;
const transitScore = normalizedTransitScore * 5;

return snow + nature30 + nature2 + travel + jobs + walkScore + bikeScore + transitScore;
```
