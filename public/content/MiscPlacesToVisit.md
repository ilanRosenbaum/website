| Singapore          | Singapore     | 1        | Food, melting pot culture, could even want to live there, I'd really love to go. |
| Stockholm          | Sweden        | 1        | Might want to live here, also same reasons as Copenhagen. |
| Oslo               | Norway        | 1        | Might want to live here, also same reasons as Copenhagen. |
| Venice             | Italy         | 3        | For Caff√® Florian, original home of espresso, serving it since 1720! Also, the rest of Venice, lol. |
| Yellowstone, WY-MT | United States | 3        | For the beauty. |
| Northern Norway    | Norway        | 3        | Pretty! |
| Sydney             | Australia     | 3        | See where my grandpa lived. |
| Hong Kong          | China         | 3        | Grandpa was here a ton, new culture, great food, they speak English! |
| The Alps           | Switzerland   | 3        | So pretty! But a million dollars, and it's similar to the Sierra Nevada mountains. But it's near a ton of other places I want to visit and accessible by train, so points for that. |
| The whole island   | Iceland       | 4        | So pretty! But a million dollars. |
| Unknown 4          | Mexico        | 4        | I'd love to actually see Mexico. Only ever been in the walled garden that is Vidanta. |
| Unknown 2          | Greece        | 5        | Greece! |
| Unknown 3          | Chile         | 5        | Pretty + new culture! |
| Unknown            | Japan         | 5        | Food + new culture + pretty. Would be a 3, but I don't know Japanese, and I'd really have to learn some to visit. |
| Shanghai           | China         | 5        | I want to visit mainland China at some point for new culture, food, transit, but like Japan, I'd really have to learn at least a little Chinese. |
