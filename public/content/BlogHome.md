## Future Stuff

- If a single human being emails me the phrase "saltine orange potato anthony lettuce" with a subject line of "gimme" I will build a newsletter feature so that when I make a new Blog it gets emailed to you immediately. There will be a box so more people can sign up in the future, but for the very next blog to come out after you send this email, you will be the only person who gets it. You also win a super special secret prize.

- If there are ever enough posts where organizing them becomes worthwhile, I plan to introduce a categorization system along with various sorting options. If you want this, you are more than welcome to ask for specific sorting methods.
