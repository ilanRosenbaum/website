# Why

Finding a place to live is hard. Finding a place to live in Madison is substantially harder. The way leasing works here you are pressured to sign a lease almost a full year in advance. This leads a lot of people to end up signing a lease for a place they do not want to live in. Maybe they dropped out, maybe they found a better place, maybe they want to do study abroad, etc. Currently those people are stuck posting on snapchat and facebook hoping to find somebody to rent their place. This means to succeed they have to repeatedly post their place because both those forms of posts are ordered chronologically or by algorithm. Additionally the people who are looking for places to potentially sublet can't search for what they want. They have to either just come across it on snapchat or get lucky that one of the better places to stay happened to be posted in a facebook group around the same time they wanted to sublet. This seemed like a pretty bad system to me. For those looking for a place to stay, they also have to deal with posts that have wildly different quality. Some posts are just plain bad, no photos of the common area, no information about the roommates, etc.

Ro≈çms is entirely free and has no ads. I made it to solve the problem described above, not to make money. If in the future there are methods of monetization it is because the app became successful enough that I was no longer in the free tier of Firebase and needed the app to be able to pay for itself.
