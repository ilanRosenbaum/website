| The Dictator's Handbook                     | favorite    | Alastair Smith and Bruce Bueno de Mesquita | 03-06-2025     | Favorite Really great arguments, really reframed how I construct some of my world views. Now I'm against foreign aid, weird, didn't expect that one. I think they have some weak spots though, they really don't tackle how money influencing politics and heightening inequality can create an essential group with few interchangeables. I think the role of inequality as a causal loop even in rich democracies was under discussed. The core points of the book are fantastic and it is very well researched, I'm a big fan.   inequality can create an essential group with few interchangeables                                            |

| Braiding Sweetgrass                         | great       | Robin Wall Kimmer                          | 06-04-2025     | The best summery I have is I learned a lot. I learned about myself, and was repeatedly reminded of what's important to me. Every night I read this book was a good night. I believe it's message strongly and I thoroughly enjoyed it. While I thoroughly enjoyed the book and learned a lot, it somehow is not a favorite. This is almost certainly because of how I read it, 10-30 pages at a time over the course of 6 months. Now is that because I didn't get sucked in or because the last 6 months were hard and making time was difficult? Maybe both, who knows. I hope I will reread this one day, and maybe then I'll know the answer. |
| The Three-Body Problem                      | good        | Ken Liu                                    | 06-09-2025     | Good book, incredibly entertaining. The exposition was a little bit heavy handed at times. Themes were fun and good but nothing special. I appreciate the effort put into the science of the sci-fi, that was the highlight for me. Near the top end of good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
### Date Notes
If I didn't know when I finished a book, but did know when I purchased it, I listed it as finished two weeks after purchase date. If I didn't know the purchase date, I guesstimated. If I really truly don't know, like for childhood books, I will guess the year and use 06-06 as month and day.

### Category Notes
For all categories other than "Favorite" the category given is how I felt after first reading the book at whatever age I was then. Favorites I have to still love. If a book was a favorite and I no longer like it at all, or not nearly as much, it gets moved down to great to acknowledge the joy it once brought me even if it doesn't any longer.
