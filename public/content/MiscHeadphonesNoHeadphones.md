# Headphones, No Headphones

## Abstract

We aim to study how many solo walkers are wearing headphones vs not wearing headphones.

## Terms

**Headphones**: For the purposes of this study any personal audio output device, eg. earbuds, over ear headphones, on ear headphones, etc. will be referred to as “Headphones”.

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

If somebody is running, they are not counted

If somebody is on a bike, they are not counted

If it can not be determined if somebody is wearing headphones or not, they are not counted

If a person is in a group of persons, meaning they are conversing with or otherwise are clearly out with another person or persons, they will not be counted

If a persons clothing, hair, or accessories (including things like ear muffs as earbuds plausible could be worn under them) prevented clear and conclusive knowledge of headphone or lack of headphone usage, they were not counted

If somebody has headphones around their neck but not on there ears, they count as no headphones

If somebody has a single earbud in, they count as headphones

## Limitations of Data Collection

Many individuals wear a single earbud, if I saw that earbud they were counted toward “headphones”, but it is plausible that some labeled as “no headphones” had an earbud in I could not see.

It is easier to conclusively identify headphone usage than a lack of headphone usage. For example if a person with long hair has full size headphones on, that is easy to identify as a headphone user. But, if that same person did not have headphones on, they may not be counted at all as it could be impossible to determines if they were wearing earbuds due to the hair.

A single person collected all this data on various walks. The data is inherently non perfect as it is a subjective human observing and recording this data. Additionally this data was recorded in the researchers mind during data collection and written down only at the conclusion of each walk. Human minds are known to be error prone \[1]\[2]
