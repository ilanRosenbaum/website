# Restaurants

## What is this?

I enjoy going to and then rating very nice restaurants. These ratings are aggressively subjective. The rating system is my own, based entirely on what matters to me. I do this because I enjoy it and for no other reason. "The List" is the primary list I use, anything on it is a place I consider incredibly good. "Didn't Make The Cut" is a list of restaurants I went to expecting them to make the list that ended up being very disappointing. All prices are in USD. Inflation adjusted prices are relative to USD. There is more detailed information on the google sheets page. This info includes: why bonus points were awarded/removed, detailed notes on each dinner, differentiation between which prices are pre/post tax, etc. [Sheets Page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q0LWe6wJalAIB0cciybzVOgQxYCs48Jv0zhhim3iwGw)
