## Key

- Enjoyment: Enjoyment is a 1 - 10 rating of how much I enjoyed my specific trip to the place in question, it may say very little about the place itself. 
- Want to return: I feel like this is pretty self explanatory. Lower is better, these are comparative scores. Some places I will have had a wonderful trip but have no interest in coming back, some places it'll be the other way around.
