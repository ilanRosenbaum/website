### Date Notes
If I didn't know when I finished a book, but did know when I purchased it, I listed it as finished two weeks after purchase date. If I didn't know the purchase date, I guesstimated. If I really truly don't know, like for childhood books, I will guess the year and use 06-06 as month and day.

### Category Notes
For all categories other than "Favorite" the category given is how I felt after first reading the book at whatever age I was then. Favorites I have to still love. If a book was a favorite and I no longer like it at all, or not nearly as much, it gets moved down to great to acknowledge the joy it once brought me even if it doesn't any longer.
