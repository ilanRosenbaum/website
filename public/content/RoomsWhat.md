Roōms is an app where users can post rentals of individual rooms. Each listing must contain a set of required information so every room listed would have enough information to help those looking for a place to stay decide if that place was right for them. Roōms allows users to search based on that required information so people can find exactly what they want immediately instead of scrolling through hundreds of posts hoping to find one that fits their needs.

Oh and if you're wondering about the dash above the second o in roōms, yes it's terrible for search engine optimization but rooms was taken on the app store and I got pretty attached to the name.
